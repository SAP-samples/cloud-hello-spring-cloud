# Important Notice
SAP has decided to stop the maintenance of this open source project and hence it'll soon be sunsetted and archived. 

Going forward, please look at [SAP Cloud Platform Appliation Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap) as the recommended approach to develop cloud applications with SAP Cloud Platform. 


SAP Cloud Platform Samples - hello spring cloud
========

This project demonstrates the usage of [Spring Cloud Connectors](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-connectors/) within a classic web application. In fact, it's a fork/rewrite of a [sample application](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/hello-spring-cloud) provided as part of the Cloud Foundry samples.

The main differences between the original sample and this fork/rewrite are as follows:

+ the original version used [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), this fork sticks to the classic approach of Spring
+ the original version compiles to a JAR file, this fork uses the classic WAR format for deployment
+ this fork provides the needed dependencies to run the application on the [SAP Cloud Platform](http://cloudplatform.sap.com)  

> **NOTE**: For further information please refer to the respective blog post: [Released: Spring Cloud Connectors for HCP](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/cloud-platform/blog/2014/12/12/released-spring-cloud-connectors-for-hcp) 

Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/SAP/cloud-hello-spring-cloud.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-hello-spring-cloud/archive/master.zip), then run a Maven build and deploy the application to your cloud platform of choice. 

### SAP Cloud Platform

The application should run as-is without any changes required. 

> **NOTE:** If you intend to deploy this application locally, you need to
add the `HC_LANDSCAPE` environment variable to your local server launch configuration. Use an arbitrary value e.g. `local`.

### Cloud Foundry

Please remember to adjust the declared services within the [`manifest.yml`](/manifest.yml) file as required for your runtime environment! 

> **NOTE:** If you intend to deploy this application to a Cloud Foundry landscape provided by SAP or its partners in order to leverage the capabilities of the SAP HANA database platform you need to manually provide the HANA JDBC driver (`ngdbc.jar`) within the [`WEB-INF/lib`](/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib) folder.
